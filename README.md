# Rubiks-Cube
 
This is a project that I gave myself that I tried and failed.
I have a pretty bad habit on giving up on projects even if I've
devoted a lot of time into them if I get slightly uninspired to 
do them. I managed to make a successfully (kinda) moving rubiks
cube as well as a display that works (kinda), once again theres
a lot of bugs that I could probably fix nowadays but I really 
don't wanna. The original goal was to have a Program solve a 
scrambled cube, but it didn't end up how I wanted it. As the 
code sits currently, the cube renders and works fine, but not 
much else. Maybe one day I'll give it a second try, but probably
not.
